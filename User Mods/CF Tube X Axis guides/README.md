BOM:

1x 	20mm CF Tube cut to your front 2020 extrusion frame size
	EX. 350mm 2020 front of frame -> 350mm 20mm CF Tube

1x	MGN12H rail as in Normal BOM matching extrusion/cf tube Length

8+	M3 Nylock Nuts for mounting rail

4+	M5 nuts, Nylock or normal are usuable


Potential Weight savings: 

85g for a 350mm CF tube and 350mm MGN12h rail in comparison to normal BOM


Notes:

- It is highly recommended to square and trim your CF tube prior to cutting to length

- CF Tube dust is very dangerous to breath in please follow safety procedures when working with it

- CF tube length and rail can be scaled to large printer size by matching rail and cf tube to front
  2020 Extrusion size. Weight savings will vary if this method is taken

- Printed parts should be fine in PLA, PETG or ABS work well also

- Cf tube dril guides are made to rest on 3 sides of the tube and can be safely held while drilling

- Narrow rail guide is meant to wrap around the whole 20mm cf tube and a MGN12 Rail, 
  CF tubes vary in diameter by upto 0.3mm along corners this may make the guide tight reprint larger

- 350mm nut holder can be inserted from either side and is initially a bit large resize width as necessary

- Mounting of the rail doesn't need the nut holder if you drill through the opposite rail side to use a 5.5mm socket
